IMP NOTS:

1. We are using GROQ API with llama3-70b-8192 (70 Billions Parameter) Model. That is Free For Now.
For Commands Parsing (Comamnds Mapping).

2. Previously We Had Used Gemini-1.5-flash Model for For Commands Parsing (Comamnds Mapping).

3. DYNAMIC FUNCTION OR CODE GENERATION: Currently we are using "Gemini-1.5-pro" Model That Have Limited Access In Daily Use.
