We have to install Tesseract for access ui elements

When you eventually turn this project into a full application, you can indeed make it install Tesseract and any other required dependencies automatically. There are a few ways to handle this for a smoother user experience:
Package with an Installer: Use a packaging tool like Inno Setup, NSIS, or an installer creation tool like PyInstaller or PyOxidizer. You can include Tesseract in the installer package and set up a script to install it in the user’s environment during installation.
Automate Tesseract Installation: You could add a script to check if Tesseract is installed on the user's system when the application starts. If it's not found, the script can download and install it automatically, similar to how package managers handle dependencies.
Dependency Management Tools: Tools like Conda or Pipenv can be packaged with the application to handle dependency management more smoothly. This might still require some configuration for Tesseract, given it’s an external application, but it’s an option worth exploring.
When the time comes, I can help design a setup that ensures smooth installation for users, along with all dependencies like Tesseract.*
